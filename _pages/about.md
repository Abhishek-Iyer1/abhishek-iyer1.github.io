Welcome to my website, I am currently pursuing my Masters in Robotic Systems Development at Carnegie Mellon University. My capstone team, [Smores](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2025teamg/project-media/), is working with the AirLab, led by Dr. Sebastian Scherer, on autonomously mapping indoor environments through dense smoke to give firefighters actionable information. All of this is done real-time, on-board, relaying information in seconds not minutes. With Smores, I have contributed to the learning based metric depth recovery pipeline, improving the performance of our visual odometry pipeline, put together our electrical subsytem, and I am focused now on enabling autonomy for the drone in dense smoke. 

Over the past summer, I interned at the Front End Innovation division at Milwaukee Tools, where I focused on perception and optimal control for a manipulator to achieve autonomy outdoors in executing a precise task in a semi-structured environment. Furthermore, I contributed to the local controller for the wheelbase allowing for precise adjustments with limited sensors. 

When I am not working, you will likely find me doing street photography, travelling, watching Ferrari lose the F1 season, or working on a robotics passion project.

**Mission Statement**

I envision a society where teams of mobile robots are contributing to our well-being on a daily basis. From mundane tasks like last mile delivery, to more extreme applications such as aiding firefighters, environmental clean ups, disaster relief and search and rescue.

To that extent, my current interests lie in the intersection of Robotics and Deep Learning. More specifically, a few focus areas that I am currently interested in -

* Shared perception, scene understanding, 3D reconstruction across a team of agents
* Context aware path planning and navigation in an dynamic environment
* Leveraging reinforcement learning to overcome data bottlenecks to enable deployment at scale
