<!-- I received my B.E. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani in 2022. -->

I am a first year student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a Masters in Robotics Systems Development. Currently, my team [Smores](https://mrsdprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2025teamg/project-media/) is working with the AirLab, led by Dr. Sebastian Scherer. My work with Smores is focused on achieving real-time 3D reconstruction of a densely smoked indoor environment while identifying points of interests to provide crucial information to firefighters for residential fires. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) with Prof. Rajiv Soundararajan on quality analysis of AI generated images using multimodal models and novel view synthesis with sparse inputs using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). When I am not working, you will likely find me going on hikes with my dslr, travelling, watching Ferrari lose the F1 season, or working on a robotics passion project.
  
**Professional Interests**

I envision a society where teams of mobile robots are contributing to our wellbeing on a daily basis. From mundane tasks like last mile delivery, to more extreme applications such as aiding firefighters, environmental clean ups, disaster relief and search and rescue.

To that extent, my current interests lie in the intersection of Perception and Machine Learning. More specifically, a few focus areas that I am currently interested in -

* Real-time 3D scene reconstruction and learning generalizable scene representations
* Improving multimodal capabilities of embodied agents for communication in natural language
* Context aware path planning and navigation in an dynamic environment
* Shared perception and scene understanding across a team of agents
